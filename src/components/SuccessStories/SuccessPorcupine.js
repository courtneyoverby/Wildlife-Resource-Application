            As a one year old wildlife center, All Things Wild Rehabilitation in
            Texas still sees a huge amount of firsts. On Christmas Eve, a wild
            porcupine arrived with severe sarcoptic mange, primarily on her head
            and tail. She also suffered with secondary skin infections and an
            upper respiratory tract infection. On top of all this, she was
            emaciated and dehydrated.
          </p>
          <p className="ss-desc">
            The rehabilitation center's first priority was to get her hydrated
            and nourished. Once the porcupine, later named 'Noelle', was
            stabilized, they began treating the mites causing her mange. After
            hours and hours of cleaning Noelleâ€™s badly crusted skin and a
            regimen of antibiotics for the infections, the wildlife vet tech was
            finally able to announce that Noelle was free of mites and on the
            mend.
